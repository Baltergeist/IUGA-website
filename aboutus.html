				<h2>What is IUGA?</h2>

				<p>The Informatics UnderGraduate Association is a Registered Student Organization (RSO) that functions as a student government for Informatics students.  IUGA provides official channels for communication between the Informatics undergraduate student body and the faculty and administration of the Information School.  IUGA promotes the interests of, and acts as an advocate for current and prospective Informatics students in/to the Information School at the University of Washington. We provide an opportunity for social, educational, and professional activities for the Informatics student body.  IUGA and its members are actively involved in the Information School community.  It is the responsibility of IUGA to provide its members with the tools to help them both in their undergraduate studies and beyond, as well as to foster a greater sense of community within the Informatics program.</p>
